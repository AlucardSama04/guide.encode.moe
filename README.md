# Fansubbing Guide

This project aims to become a public guide
for aspiring as well as veteran fansubbers
that everyone can contribute to.
It is currently under construction
as many topics are still missing,
but will hopefully cover all important areas
and roles that go into the fansubbing process.
(*Please help by improving the pages
and filling in TODO entries.
